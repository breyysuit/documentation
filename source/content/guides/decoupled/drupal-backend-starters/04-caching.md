The recommended caching settings are automatically configured and enabled if you created your Drupal site using the [backend starter project](/guides/decoupled/drupal-backend-starters/create), including:

- JSON:API is configured to cache responses for 10 minutes.
- The Pantheon Advanced Page Cache module is enabled. This enables edge caching and purging across the entire decoupled stack.

## Manual Configuration

You can manually enable edge caching and purging if you did not use the Decoupled Kit backend starter project. The Edge caching instructions below focus on sites running on Pantheon, but can be adapted for other platforms.

### Enable caching for JSON:API

1. Open your **Drupal Admin**, select **Configuration**, select **Development**, and then select **Performance**.

1. Set the **Browser and proxy cache maximum age** to a value greater than zero. Refer to [Drupal Caching](/drupal-cache#caching) for more information.

### Enable Edge Caching

1. Run the following Composer command:

    ```bash{promptUser: user}
    composer require drupal/pantheon_advanced_page_cache
    ```

1. Enable the Pantheon Advanced Page Cache module.
